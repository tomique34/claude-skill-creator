# Meeting Notes to Action Items Converter

## Overview

Automatically transform demo meeting notes, feedback sessions, and product reviews into structured, actionable tasks. Extracts action items from unstructured notes and formats them as TODO lists, JIRA tickets, or Trello cards with proper priorities, assignees, and deadlines.

## Quick Start

Provide meeting notes from a demo session and specify the output format:

```
"Convert these demo notes to action items"
"Create JIRA tickets from this feedback session"
"Extract tasks from this meeting transcript and format as TODO list"
```

The skill will:
1. Analyze the notes to identify action items
2. Extract key information (who, what, when, priority)
3. Format as requested (TODO, JIRA, Trello)
4. Optionally generate API calls or scripts for automatic creation

## Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Demo Notes

Accept notes in various formats:
- **Meeting transcripts** - Raw text from recordings or live notes
- **Bullet point notes** - Structured notes with key points
- **Email summaries** - Demo feedback sent via email
- **Slack/Teams messages** - Chat discussions about the demo
- **Voice-to-text transcripts** - Automated transcriptions

**Identify Action Items:**

Look for patterns indicating tasks:
- "We need to..."
- "Should fix..."
- "TODO:", "Action item:"
- "[Name] will..."
- "By [date]..."
- "High priority:", "Critical:"
- Questions that require follow-up
- Bug reports or issues mentioned
- Feature requests
- Documentation updates needed

**Extract Context:**
- **What** needs to be done (task description)
- **Who** is responsible (assignee)
- **When** it's due (deadline/sprint)
- **Why** it matters (context from demo)
- **Priority** level (based on language and context)
- **Category** (bug, feature, improvement, documentation)

### Step 2: Structure Action Items

Transform raw notes into structured tasks with:

**Clear Task Titles:**
- Action-oriented (verb first)
- Specific and concise
- Include relevant context

Examples:
- ‚ùå "The button thing"
- ‚úÖ "Fix checkout button not responding on mobile"

**Detailed Descriptions:**
- Context from the demo
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Acceptance criteria
- Additional notes or references

**Proper Categorization:**
- **Bug**: Issues that don't work as expected
- **Feature**: New functionality requests
- **Improvement**: Enhancements to existing features
- **Documentation**: Docs, guides, or help text
- **Design**: UI/UX changes
- **Investigation**: Research or spike tasks

**Priority Assignment:**

Based on impact and urgency:
- **Critical/P0**: Blocking issues, security problems
- **High/P1**: Important features, major bugs
- **Medium/P2**: Standard tasks, minor bugs
- **Low/P3**: Nice-to-haves, minor improvements

Indicators:
- "Critical", "urgent", "ASAP" ‚Üí High priority
- "When you get a chance", "nice to have" ‚Üí Low priority
- Blocking other work ‚Üí High priority
- Cosmetic issues ‚Üí Low priority

**Assignee Identification:**

- Explicit mentions: "John will handle this"
- Role-based: "Frontend team should fix"
- Inferred from context: Bug in login ‚Üí Backend team
- Default to "Unassigned" if unclear

**Deadline Extraction:**

- Explicit dates: "By Friday", "End of sprint"
- Relative dates: "This week", "Next sprint"
- Inferred urgency: Critical bugs ‚Üí Immediate
- Default: "To be determined" if not specified

### Step 3: Format Output

```
## Context from Demo
John suggested adding a search history feature so users can quickly
re-run previous searches. Sarah agreed it's a good idea but not
critical for now.

## What Needs to Be Done
Implement a search history feature that stores and displays recent
searches for easy re-use.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Store recent searches (suggest last 10-20)
- [ ] Display search history in dropdown
- [ ] Click to re-run previous search
- [ ] Clear history option
- [ ] Privacy consideration (don't store sensitive searches?)
- [ ] Persists across sessions

## Additional Notes
Tabled for now as not critical. Revisit after core search features
are stable and performant.

## Future Considerations
- Should history be per-user or per-device?
- How long to keep history?
- Privacy/security implications?
```

**Checklist Items**:
- [ ] Design UX for history feature
- [ ] Determine storage mechanism (localStorage, database)
- [ ] Implement history tracking
- [ ] Add UI for viewing/using history
- [ ] Add clear history functionality
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Clear Action Items

1. **Use Action Verbs**: Start with "Fix", "Add", "Update", "Investigate", "Create"
2. **Be Specific**: Include enough detail to understand the task without the meeting notes
3. **Include Context**: Why is this important? What demo feedback led to this?
4. **Set Clear Criteria**: What does "done" look like?
5. **Assign Ownership**: Who is responsible? (even if it's "Unassigned")

### Prioritization Guidelines

**Critical/High Priority:**
- Blocking bugs preventing release
- Security issues
- Features explicitly requested as "urgent" or "ASAP"
- Major usability issues affecting core functionality

**Medium Priority:**
- Important features for next sprint
- Bugs that don't block release
- Performance improvements
- UX enhancements

**Low Priority:**
- Nice-to-have features
- Cosmetic issues
- Future enhancements
- Questions for later discussion

### Extracting Information from Messy Notes

**Common Patterns:**

| Note Pattern | Extract As |
|--------------|------------|
| "X will do Y" | Assignee: X, Task: Y |
| "Should/need to..." | Action item |
| "By Friday/end of week" | Deadline |
| "Critical/urgent/ASAP" | High priority |
| "Nice to have/eventually" | Low priority |
| "Bug:", "Issue:", "Problem:" | Bug category |
| "Feature request:", "Could we..." | Feature category |
| "?" at end | Follow-up question |

**Handling Ambiguity:**

- **No assignee mentioned**: Mark as "Unassigned" or assign to relevant team
- **No deadline**: Use "TBD" or infer from context (critical bugs = immediate)
- **Unclear priority**: Default to Medium, note in description
- **Vague description**: Add note that clarification is needed

### Platform-Specific Tips

**TODO Lists:**
- Group by priority for easy scanning
- Use checkboxes for progress tracking
- Keep all metadata with each task
- Add a "Follow-up Questions" section

**JIRA:**
- Use proper issue types (Bug, Story, Task)
- Add labels for easy filtering
- Include story points if you can estimate
- Link related tickets
- Use components and fix versions
- Add detailed acceptance criteria

**Trello:**
- Use color-coded labels consistently
- Add checklists for multi-step tasks
- Set due dates for time-sensitive items
- Use descriptions for full context
- Position critical items at top
- @mention relevant people

## Common Patterns to Recognize

### Bug Reports in Demo Notes

**Indicators:**
- "Not working"
- "Broken"
- "Error"
- "Crashed"
- "Failed"
- "Issue with..."

**Extract:**
- What's broken
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Browser/device if mentioned

### Feature Requests

**Indicators:**
- "Should have..."
- "Could we add..."
- "Would be nice..."
- "Users want..."
- "Missing..."

**Extract:**
- What feature
- Why it's needed
- Who requested it
- Priority level

### Questions/Clarifications

**Indicators:**
- "?"
- "Need to ask..."
- "Should we..."
- "Not sure if..."
- "To be determined"

**Extract:**
- The question
- Who can answer
- Why it matters
- Blocking or non-blocking

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Provide Complete Context**: Include who attended, what was demoed, date
2. **Preserve Original Notes**: Don't pre-process too much, let the skill extract
3. **Specify Output Format**: Be clear about TODO vs JIRA vs Trello
4. **Mention Project Context**: JIRA project key, Trello board name, etc.
5. **Include Urgency Signals**: Mention if anything is critical or blocking
6. **Identify Attendees**: Helps with assignee identification
7. **Note Decisions Made**: Include any decisions or agreements from the demo

## Troubleshooting

**Too Many Tasks Created:**
- The skill might be too aggressive in identifying action items
- Review and merge related tasks
- Mark some as "Questions" instead of "Tasks"

**Missing Context:**
- Original notes might be too vague
- Add more detail when providing input
- Include speaker names and timestamps

**Wrong Priorities:**
- Double-check priority assignments
- Adjust based on your team's criteria
- Add notes about why priority was chosen

**Unclear Assignees:**
- Provide team structure context
- Explicitly mention who should handle what
- Use "Unassigned" and assign during triage
