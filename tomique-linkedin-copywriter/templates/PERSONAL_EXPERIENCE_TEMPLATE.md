- People: Team size, roles involved
- Scale: Size of problem/solution

**Show Vulnerability:**
- Admit mistakes honestly
- Share doubts and concerns

- "What lessons have you learned from your projects?"

## Hashtag Guide

**Formula for experience posts:**
- 1 professional role hashtag (#CloudArchitecture, #DevOps)
- 2 technology hashtags from the story
- 1 lesson/theme hashtag (#LessonsLearned, #Leadership)
- 2 industry hashtags (#TechIndustry, #Innovation)

## Tips

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Start with emotion or drama
- Show the journey, not just outcome
- Include specific numbers
- Be vulnerable about challenges
- Share credit with team
- Extract universal lesson

‚ùå **Don't:**

## Complete Example (English)

```
Client asked for "AI automation". We delivered. They rejected it. ü§î

Here's what happened:

Built perfect AI agent:
- 95% accuracy
- 10x faster than human process
- Saved 20 hours/week

Client used it for 2 days. Then stopped.

Why?

We automated THEIR process.
But didn't understand their REAL workflow.

The problem:
- AI handled happy path perfectly
- But edge cases (20% of work) needed human judgment
- No clear handoff between AI and human
- People felt they lost control

What we changed:
1. AI suggests, human confirms
2. Clear confidence scores on every decision
3. Easy override mechanism
4. Gradually increased automation as trust built

Result:
- Now using it daily
- Started at 30% automation
- Month 3: Up to 75%
- Team loves it

Lesson learned:
Don't automate processes.
Augment people.

What's your experience with AI adoption? What worked?
