## Complete Example (English)

```
Another "Cloud is too expensive" article. Here's the real story. üí∏

The article blames cloud providers.
I blame how we architect.

Last quarter, I audited 3 clients' AWS bills.
Average savings: 45%.
Changed infrastructure? No.
Changed how services communicate? Yes.

The problem isn't cloud pricing.
It's inter-service data transfer nobody monitors.

One client:
- Same compute, storage, everything
- Optimized data flow patterns
- Monthly bill: $12K ‚Üí $6.5K

The expensive part isn't running services.
It's how they talk to each other.

Zauj√≠mav√Ω ƒçl√°nok o AI v IoT. Len zabudli na realitu. ü§î

ƒål√°nok hovor√≠: "AI transformuje IoT".
S√∫hlas√≠m.

ƒål√°nok nehovor√≠: "90% IoT zariaden√≠ nem√° dos≈• v√Ωkonu na AI".
Aj to je realita.

Rie≈°il som to minul√Ω mesiac:
‚Üí Edge zariadenia: pr√≠li≈° slab√© na AI
‚Üí Cloud: pr√≠li≈° vysok√° latencia
‚Üí Hybrid: AI na edge len pre urgent cases, batch processing v cloude

V√Ωsledok:
- 200ms latencia ‚Üí 15ms pre kritick√© situ√°cie
- N√°klady poloviƒçn√© oproti full-cloud AI
- 99.9% uptime

AI v IoT funguje. Ale nie tak, ako to popisuj√∫ ƒçl√°nky.
Potrebujete hybrid pr√≠stup.
