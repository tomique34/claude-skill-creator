# Changelog Newsletter Creator

## Overview

Convert technical changelog entries into engaging, user-friendly newsletter content suitable for email campaigns, blog posts, and release notes pages. This skill helps translate developer-focused change descriptions into benefits-oriented content for end users.

## Quick Start

Provide a changelog file or list of changes, and specify the desired output format (email, blog post, or release notes page). The skill will:
1. Identify change types (features, fixes, improvements, breaking changes)
2. Rewrite technical descriptions in user-friendly language
3. Organize content by impact and importance
4. Format for the target medium

## Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Changelog Input

Accept changelog entries in various formats:
- **Markdown CHANGELOG.md files** (Keep a Changelog format)
- **Git commit logs** (structured or conventional commits)
- **Raw change lists** (bullet points or paragraphs)
- **Release notes** (existing technical documentation)

Identify and categorize:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Improvements/enhancements
- Breaking changes
- Deprecations
- Security updates

### Step 2: Transform to User-Friendly Language

Apply these transformation principles:

**Technical ‚Üí User-Friendly:**
- "Fixed null pointer exception in payment processor" ‚Üí "Resolved an issue that could cause checkout to fail"
- "Implemented OAuth2 authentication flow" ‚Üí "Added secure single sign-on with your favorite services"
- "Optimized database query performance" ‚Üí "Made the app faster and more responsive"
- "Deprecated legacy API endpoints" ‚Üí "Upgrading our system for better reliability (action required)"

**Focus on benefits, not implementation:**
- What problem does this solve for users?
- What can users now do that they couldn't before?
- How does this improve their experience?

### Step 3: Organize by Priority and Impact

Structure content by user impact:

1. **Headline Features** - Major new capabilities
2. **Improvements** - Enhanced existing features
3. **Fixes** - Resolved issues (group similar fixes)
4. **Coming Changes** - Deprecations or upcoming breaking changes

Prioritize what users care about most:
- Visible changes over internal improvements
- Fixes for common pain points
- Features that enable new workflows

### Step 4: Format for Target Medium

```markdown
## Version 3.1.0 - January 15, 2025

### Improvements

- **Faster Performance**: We've upgraded our infrastructure
  to deliver faster page loads and quicker response times.

- **Better Reliability**: Enhanced monitoring helps us catch
  and fix issues before they affect you.

- **Improved Stability**: Resolved a background processing
  issue that could cause delays in scheduled tasks.

### Technical Updates

- Database and caching infrastructure upgrades
- Dependency updates for security and performance

As always, we're working behind the scenes to make the product
faster and more reliable.
```

## Best Practices

### Writing User-Friendly Content

1. **Lead with benefits** - Answer "What's in it for me?"
2. **Use active voice** - "You can now..." not "Users are able to..."
3. **Be specific** - "3x faster" not "improved performance"
4. **Group related items** - Don't list 20 individual bug fixes
5. **Avoid jargon** - No database names, framework versions, or architecture details unless necessary

### Handling Different Change Types

**Features:**
- Emphasize new capabilities and use cases
- Include examples or screenshots when possible
- Link to tutorials or documentation

**Bug Fixes:**
- Focus on the user impact, not the technical cause
- Group similar fixes together
- Only highlight fixes for issues users likely experienced

**Breaking Changes:**
- Make them prominent (use warning emoji or styling)
- Explain what users need to do
- Provide migration guide links
- Give timeline if applicable

**Internal/Infrastructure:**
- Translate to user benefits (speed, reliability, security)
- Group under "Improvements" or "Performance"
- Don't list every dependency update

### Tone and Style

- **Conversational but professional** - friendly without being overly casual
- **Enthusiastic about improvements** - celebrate wins
- **Honest about issues** - acknowledge and explain fixes
- **Respectful of user time** - be concise

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Too many minor changes to list:**
Group them by category and summarize. For example: "Fixed several issues with form validation" instead of listing 8 individual input field bugs.

**Highly technical changes:**
Focus on the outcome, not the implementation. "Improved security" rather than "Implemented bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds."

**Breaking changes requiring action:**
Always include: what's changing, why it matters, what users need to do, and when they need to do it by.

**Nothing user-facing this release:**
If it's all internal improvements, frame it as: "Behind-the-scenes improvements for better performance, security, and reliability."

## Additional Considerations

### Segmentation
Consider creating different versions for different audiences:
- **End users**: Focus on features and user-visible fixes
- **Developers/API users**: Include API changes, SDK updates
- **Admins**: Highlight security, compliance, configuration changes

### Linking Strategy
Always link to:
- Detailed documentation for complex features
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Video demos or screenshots for visual features
- Full changelog for technical details

### Timing
- **Email newsletters**: Monthly or quarterly summaries
- **Blog posts**: Major releases or significant feature launches
- **Release notes**: Every release, even minor ones
